# [Project](https://rekindle.vercel.app/) - Hotline Service Tool

rekindle is an online mental health hotline service accessible to both users and hotline responders. users are encouraged to talk to trained personnel, first describing their situation to an input system; instantaneously; OpenAI natural language processing models (initially co:here) extract needed information from the user circumstance and provides a summary and a list of potential solutions. The summary of the alleged case and list of solutions are delivered to an open hotline worker/volunteer, who is informed with crucial facts and resources such as emergency phone numbers or counselling options for the user.
